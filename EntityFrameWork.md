# Entity FrameWork
* Entity Framework is an open-source ORM (Object Relational Mapping) Framework for the .NET applications supported by Microsoft. 
* It enables the developers to work with the data using the objects of domain-specific classes without focussing on the database tables and columns where the data is stored. 
* Entity Framework can generate the necessary database commands for reading or writing data in the database and execute them for us.
*  we can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code when compared with traditional applications.
